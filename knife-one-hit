I've got a new story now and it goes like this
I took my hand out of my pocket up came a fist
It was headline news
One more abuse
I've got to tell it with a fist
And it goes like this

Ho ho ho ho
Huh huh huh huh

So where's the femininity
The one with skirts and high heels
A shiny sink and home made meals
The one and only way
If you enter you'll stay
Sons and daughters you will breed
As long as you breastfeed
Yeah being a man is a bliss
One Hit one Kiss

Ho ho ho ho
Huh huh huh huh
